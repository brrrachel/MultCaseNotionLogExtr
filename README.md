# MultCaseNotionLogExtrThis repository hosts all data for our project in the Data Extraction for Process Mining Seminar Project by Rachel Brabender and Oliver Clasen.## Setup PythonWe are using some libraries which are not part of the normal python libraries. Therefore, we use the package manager brew and pip3. In order to check weather you have installed all necessary dependencies please run:```bash installLibraries.sh```## Run Process SimulatorThe code below executes our self-written process simulator which creates the extended_tableLog.csv file as a basis for the different case notion extractions.```python3 process_simulator.py```## Run XES Log ExtractorFor extracting XES logs from our simulated database, you can choose up to two views (columns) in order to derive an XES log file.```python3 xes_log_tool.py column1 column2```
